# 📌 The Problem  

India is facing a growing **“Credit Invisible” Crisis**.

Millions of gig workers and freelancers earn through:

🚕 Ride-hailing platforms  
🍔 Delivery services  
💻 Freelancing marketplaces  
📱 Digital content platforms  

Yet they struggle to access formal credit because:

- ❌ No CIBIL credit history  
- ❌ No salary slips  
- ❌ No employer verification  
- ❌ Irregular income patterns  

Despite active UPI usage and bank accounts, they are treated as high-risk borrowers.

This forces many to rely on **informal lenders charging 40–50% interest**, leading to financial exclusion and debt traps.

---

# 💡 Our Solution – Gig-Score  

Gig-Score is an **AI-powered alternative credit scoring platform** built specifically for the gig economy.

Instead of traditional salary-based models, we analyze:

📊 Platform payout history  
📈 Income consistency & trends  
⭐ Work activity & ratings  
💳 Cash-flow behavior  

We convert this alternative data into a transparent and reliable **Gig Credit Score**.
