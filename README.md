## 📌 Problem Statement  

India is experiencing a growing **“credit invisible” crisis**.  

Millions of gig workers, freelancers, and first-time earners actively participate in the digital economy through platforms such as ride-hailing, delivery services, and freelance marketplaces. However, they face significant barriers when applying for formal credit due to:

- Lack of CIBIL credit history  
- Absence of salary slips or employer verification  
- Irregular income patterns  
- Thin-file or non-existent credit records  

Despite maintaining active bank accounts and using UPI-based digital transactions, they are frequently classified as high-risk borrowers.

As a result, many rely on informal lenders charging interest rates as high as 40–50%, leading to financial exclusion and long-term debt cycles.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution – Gig-Score  

Gig-Score is an AI-powered alternative credit scoring platform designed specifically for gig workers.

Instead of relying solely on traditional salary-based evaluation models, Gig-Score analyzes:

- Platform payout history  
- Income consistency and trends  
- Work activity levels  
- Behavioral financial signals  
- Cash-flow stability  

The system converts this alternative data into a structured **Gig Credit Score**, enabling financial institutions to assess creditworthiness more accurately and fairly.
