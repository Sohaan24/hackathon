## 📌 Problem Statement

Millions of freelancers and gig workers in India face loan rejection because:

- ❌ No salary slips  
- ❌ No fixed monthly income  
- ❌ Low or no CIBIL score  
- ❌ Irregular earnings  

Traditional banking systems are built for salaried employees, not gig workers.

This leads to financial exclusion and dependence on high-interest informal lending.

## 💡 Our Solution – Gig-Score

Gig-Score is an AI-powered platform that:

- Connects gig platforms (Uber, Swiggy, Fiverr, etc.)
- Analyzes income patterns over time
- Evaluates work consistency and ratings
- Generates a Gig Credit Score
- Predicts loan eligibility

Instead of salary slips, we use real digital earning data.
