## 📌 Problem Statement

Millions of freelancers and gig workers in India struggle to access loans and credit cards because:

- ❌ No fixed salary  
- ❌ No salary slips  
- ❌ Low or no CIBIL score  
- ❌ Irregular income patterns  

Traditional banking systems are built for salaried employees — not modern gig workers.

- Analyzes digital income patterns
